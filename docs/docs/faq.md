# Frequently Asked Questions

This pages provides a user guide of the library through Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).

## What is a minimal, working example of RobotDART

## What robots are supported in RobotDART?

RobotDART supports any robot that can be described by a URDF, SDF, SKEL or MJCF file. Nevertheless, we have a curated list of robots with edited and optimized models to be used with RobotDART (see the [robots page](robots) for details and examples).

## How can I load my own URDF/SDF/SKEL/MJCF file?

See the [robots page](robots) for details.

## How do I enable graphics in my code?

## How do I record a video?

## How can I manipulate the camera?

## How can I display debug information?

## What do the numbers in the status bar mean?

## How can I visualize the state of my model?

## Can I add change the graphics scene (e.g., change lighting conditions)?

## How can I control my robot? Can I have a position-,velocity-,torque-controlled robot?

## Is there a way to control the simulation timestep?

## What is the difference between the DART and the FCL collision detector? How can I choose between them?

## My robot does not self-collide. How can I change this?

## How can I compute kinematic/dynamic properties of my robot (e.g., Jacobians, Mass Matrix)?

## Is there a way to change the joint or link (body) properties (e.g., actuation, mass)?

## What are the supported sensors? How can I use an IMU?

## I want to have multiple camera sensors. Is it possible? How can I attach a camera to a moving link?

## How can I measure forces being applied to my robot?

## How can I spawn multiple robots in parallel?

## I need to simulate many worlds with camera sensors in parallel. How can I do this?

## I do not know how to use waf. How can I detect RobotDART from CMake?

## I prefer coding in python. How can I use RobotDART?
